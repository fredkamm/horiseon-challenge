## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation towards this porject was making sure the site ran perfectly without changing the design of the web page.  
- Customer wanted a codebase that follows accessiblity standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.
- The customers site is more likely to come up when other people are lookking for their site through search engines. 
- I learned that one of the links on the navigation bar was not working properly. Also noticed that the code was very sloppy so i spent some time cleaning that up to make it more organized without changing the layout of the web page. 

## Usage

Using the links is a helpful way to navigate this web page. Each link will take you to the proper screen so that the topic of choice is viewbale on the users screen. The example below shows when the link in the nav bar "Search Engine Optimization" is clicked, the page will automatically take the user to the proper screen for a deaper description of the topic.
